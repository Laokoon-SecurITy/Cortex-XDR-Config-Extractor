## Getting Hold of Database Lock Files
### Agent Version <7.8
With Agent Versions prior to 7.8 any authenticated user can generate a Support File on Windows via Cortex XDR Console in the System Tray.
The databse lock files can be found within the zip:
```
logs_[ID].zip\Persistence\agent_settings.db\
```

</p>


### Agent Version â‰¥7.8
Support files from Agents running Version 7.8 or higher are encrypted, but if you have elevated privileges on the Windows Maschine the files can be directly copied from the following directory, without encryption.

#### Method I
```
C:\ProgramData\Cyvera\LocalSystem\Persistence\agent_settings.db\
```
#### Method II
Generated Support Files are not deleted regulary, so it might be possible to find old, unencrypted Support Files in the following folder:
```
C:\Users\[Username]\AppData\Roaming\PaloAltoNetworks\Traps\support\
```
### Agent Version >8.1
Supposedly, since Agent version 8.1, it should no longer be possible to pull the data from the lock files. This has not been tested yet.
